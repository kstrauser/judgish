# Judgish

Analyze and judge the people you follow on Twitter

# Motivation

I found myself mostly reading lists of just a few select users because my
"home" timeline was far too busy to stay current with it. I had an epiphany:
maybe I'd be better off unfollowing or muting the chattiest users if I wasn't
reading their posts anyway.

Judgish stems from my attempt to reclaim my Twitter timeline.
